AI mode - human vs computer / computer vs computer: The AI function calculates the optimal position for placing the current brick based on the shape of the brick and the congestion of the board.
The function prioritizes certain actions: first, the computer attempts to clear as many rows as possible; then it tries to clear a single row and avoid creating empty spaces on the board; next, it aims to go as deep into the board as possible. If none of these options are effective or possible, the computer resorts to a random move.
